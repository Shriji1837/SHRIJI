## Security Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Lack of Potential Scripting Elements

**Status:** No vulnerability found

- The provided SVG does not contain `<script>`, `<foreignObject>`, `<animate>`, or any event-handler attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`) that typically lead to XSS via SVG.

### 2. Unsafe Resource References

**Status:** No vulnerability found

- There are no `<image>`, `<use>`, or external resource-loading elements that could be exploited to inject malicious content.

### 3. Malicious Attribute Injection

**Status:** No vulnerability found

- All elements and attributes are plain. No unexpected or dangerous attributes present.

### 4. XML Entity Expansion (Billion Laughs Attack)

**Status:** No vulnerability found

- The SVG does not use DTDs or entities.

### 5. Overly Permissive Content

**Status:** No vulnerability found

- The SVG does not contain interactive or dynamic content.

## Recommendations

- **Restrict SVG Uploads:** If accepting SVGs from untrusted sources, always sanitize and validate input as SVG can potentially carry security risks.
- **Static Analysis:** Use a proper SVG sanitizer or allow only a set of safe elements and attributes.
- **Serve SVGs Safely:** Consider serving SVGs with proper `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` and with appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- **No Inline Execution:** Avoid including user-generated SVG content inline if not sanitizedâ€”prefer embedding as images.

## Summary

**No security vulnerabilities were detected in the provided SVG code.**  
The SVG is static and does not contain elements or attributes that are commonly associated with security risks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), embedded scripts, or external resource inclusion.

> **Note:** The security stance could change if SVG contents are user-supplied or if the code is modified to include scripting or interactive features.
