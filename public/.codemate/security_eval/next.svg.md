# Security Vulnerability Report for Provided SVG Code

## Code Analyzed

The following SVG code was provided for analysis:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 394 80">
  <path ... />
  <path ... />
</svg>
```

## Security Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Embedded SVG Code

SVG files are text-based image formats that support a broad range of features, including embedded scripts, external references, and interaction with CSS and HTML. They can be a vector for several vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

#### a. **Inline SVG - Security Context**

**Risk:**  
If SVG is rendered in a browser or application that allows untrusted user input, SVG code can execute scripts or reference external resources.

- **Script Injection:**  
  SVG supports inline `<script>` elements and event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`), which can be used for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly sanitized.

- **External Resource Loading:**  
  SVG elements like `<image>`, `<use>`, or `<script>` can load external content, which can be used for data exfiltration or delivering malicious payloads.

**Assessment for Current Code:**  
- ✅ No `<script>`, `<image>`, `<foreignObject>`, or event handler attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`) are present.
- ✅ No use of `<use>` tags referencing external content or `<a>` links.
- ✅ Only `<svg>` and `<path>` elements with hard-coded attributes appear.
- ✅ No dynamic values or user-provided parameters.

#### b. **XML Entity Attacks (XXE)**

**Risk:**  
SVG is XML, so XXE (XML External Entity) attacks may be possible if the SVG is processed by a vulnerable XML parser on the backend (rather than in a browser context).

**Assessment for Current Code:**  
- ✅ No DOCTYPE or external entities defined.

#### c. **File Injection / Malformed SVG**

**Risk:**  
Malformed SVG files or objects with huge complexity or depth could lead to denial-of-service if parsed by unsuspecting libraries. Malicious SVGs can also exploit vulnerabilities in poorly-written SVG parsers.

**Assessment for Current Code:**  
- ✅ The code contains only simple `<path>` elements and is not excessively complex; risk is low.

## Security Recommendations

### 1. **SVG Sanitization**
- Always sanitize SVG content before displaying it, especially if it originates from user input.
- Remove scripts, event handlers, and dangerous elements (e.g., `<script>`, `<foreignObject>`, `<iframe>`, `<a>`, external links) using an SVG sanitizer tool.

### 2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- Implement a strong CSP to prevent SVG-based XSS, e.g., disallow `script-src` and restrict `object-src` and `img-src`.

### 3. **Serving SVG as Images**
- If you do not need SVG interactivity, serve SVGs with the `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` header and embed using `<img>` or CSS `background-image` rather than inline `<svg>` or `<object>` to reduce XSS risk.

### 4. **Backend File Parsing**
- If parsing or processing SVGs server-side, use secure parsers, disable external entity expansion, and validate all inputs.

## Conclusion

**The provided SVG code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities in its markup as shared.**  
However, the broader security risks of SVG files remain relevant if:
- The SVG is user-submitted,
- It is not properly sanitized,
- Or your application allows SVG interactivity.

**No direct XSS, external resource loading, or XXE vector is present in this SVG sample.**

**If you are rendering this SVG in an environment where it can be user-modified or user-submitted, you must sanitize the input and serve with appropriate security best practices as noted above.**
